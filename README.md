# Tailwind CSS Gradient Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with Tailwind CSS gradient functionality.  The gradient may not render correctly, appearing as a solid color or exhibiting unexpected color transitions.  The solution provided addresses this issue.

## Bug Report

When attempting to use Tailwind's gradient utility classes (e.g., `bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500`), the gradient does not apply as expected.  Instead of a smooth color transition, the output displays a single solid color.

## Solution

This issue can often be resolved by ensuring your Tailwind configuration is correctly set up, including proper plugin inclusion and postcss configuration, and by double-checking the gradient syntax for accuracy.
